Floe is working with [PhET](http://phet.colorado.edu/)
to improve the accessibility of their free, open, interactive physics simulations.
Over the past year, we have contributed research, ideas, and evaluations for improvements
to two of PhET's simulations: [Forces and Motion Basics](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Forces+and+Motion+Simulation+Design)
and [John Travoltage](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Simulation+Design).

The PhET team has been working to incorporate our input into a development
version of the [Forces and Motion: Basics](http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.5-accessible-instance.3/forces-and-motion-basics_enhtml?accessibility&screens=1)
simulation, and is now conducting user tests. Implementation of the new designs for the John Travoltage
simulation is planned for December 2015.

From this collaboration with PhET, a guide "[Web Games and Simulations](http://handbook.floeproject.org/WebGamesAndSimulations.html)
"has been added to the [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](http://handbook.floeproject.org/)
to help educators create more inclusive and accessible web games and
educational simulations.
