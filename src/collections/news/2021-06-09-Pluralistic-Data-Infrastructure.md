title: Pluralistic Data Infrastructure

The pluralistic data infrastructure allows learners to take control of their data and its relationships. Featuring an
open, declarative pipeline that regularly fetches upstream data and weaves it together whilst maintaining its
provenance, the system can automatically retrigger the republishing of a visualization.

The aim is to put tools in the hands of communities for publishing their own data and visualizations derived from it,
while maintaining the relationship with data managed by other communities.
