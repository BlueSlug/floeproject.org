In a traditional word cloud, the most popular answers (e.g. words, phrases) are emphasized. The result of this emphasis
is for the minority to fade away into the background. With their work on Inverted Wordles, the We Count team is seaking
a way to invert that relationship and provide a means to amplify those minority voices.

                In this Inverted Wordle, the minority answers are emphasised, appearing larger, while the
                majority responses appear smaller. For example "formative feedback" and "differentiation in design"
                appear more prominently; where as, "open" and "safety" appear smaller. Visually all of the words are
                arranged at different angles and appear in different colours. However, the most salient dimension is the
                size of the font the words are displayed in. It's also worth noting that some of the de-emphasized words
                are sufficiently small that they are unreadable. If there was no option to invert the word cloud, these
                ideas would be lost.
