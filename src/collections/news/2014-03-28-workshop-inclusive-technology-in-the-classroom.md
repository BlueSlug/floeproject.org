Earlier this week, the Floe team conducted a workshop with the
[Vitrine technologie-éducation (VTÉ)](http://www.vteducation.org/en/articles/step/information-and-communication-technology-integration-post-secondary-education).
The workshop discussed the use of technology to create an inclusive
classroom, and highlighted the work of the Floe project.
