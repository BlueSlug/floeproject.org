In April 2021, students from British Columbia partook in art making workshops using the [Weavly](https://weavly.org/)
tool to draw and make music. Their feedback is being incorporated into future versions of Weavly.

The Coding to Learn and Create team has shared a summary of the feedback in their blog post,
[Improving Weavly Through Art Workshops](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/art-workshop/).
