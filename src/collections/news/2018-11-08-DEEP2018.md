The 2018 [Designing Enabling Economies and Policies](https://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/)
(DEEP) event was held on October 12th and 13th with a dual emphasis on Smart Cities and the 25
years of research and development at the
[Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/)
(IDRC). A half day co-design activity aimed at creating an OER toolkit about co-design was held
with Floe project team members. Read more about the co-design activity and outcomes on the
