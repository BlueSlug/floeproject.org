A WordPress plugin is now available for
[Learner Options](http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/).
The plugin adds the Learner Options component to any WordPress site, allowing visitors to adjust
things like text size, text style, contrast, and line spacing.

The Learner Options plugin is still in early development, but it has been deployed on
[this blog.](http://tjbliss.org/a-one-size-fits-one-experience-on-tjbliss-org/)

The plugin is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/),
and questions and comments are welcomed on the [fluid-work mailing list](http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/mailman/listinfo/fluid-work).
