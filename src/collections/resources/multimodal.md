### Multimodal presentation, content adaptation and personal preferences

Digital design offers diverse possibilities for transformation and adaptation of learning content. How do we leverage
these possibilities in envisioning, building and evolving tools for learning to support diverse learning needs?

* [User Interface Options Video (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63DqNgxtsrA")
  Learn about the Fluid Project's User Interface Options (UIO) component, how it enables people to personalise web
  content to meet their unique needs, and how to integrate it into a site. A beta version of a
  [Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%2B/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek)
  is now available, enabling UIO to transform content of web pages that do not have a direct integration of UIO.
* [Multimodal Design Patterns for Inclusion &amp; Accessibility](http://www.alanharnum.ca/post/2017-06-01-multimodal-design-for-inclusion/)
  A presentation from the 2017 University of Guelph Accessibility Conference discussing multimodality as a tool for
  building inclusive experiences and shifting perceptions.
* [Nexus Science Lab Video (2017)](https://youtu.be/NNwc0VYRhUU)
  See how sensors commonly found in a science lab can be connected to accessible, sonified graphs using the
  [Nexus, a system that connects disparate technologies](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Nexus_API), enabling new and inclusive
  interactions that can be used to visualize and sonify data as it is gathered.
* [Nexus Inclusive Music Creation Video (2016)](https://youtu.be/7R_pz2Fz4qE)
  See a demonstration of the Nexus being used to inclusively create music using various inputs including a head tracker.
* [Sonification](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Sonification)
  Try the [inclusive chart authoring tool](https://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/) that automatically
  sonifies data using the sonification framework that provides a set of tools to help web developers more easily create
  sound-based representations of interactive data.
* [Harmonious Authorship from Different Representations (2015)](http://www.ppig.org/library/paper/harmonious-authorship-different-representations)
  > “We describe the Infusion system, which is a library, language system or integration domain implemented in
    JavaScript, as well as a mentality and model for thinking about the ex- pression of end-user applications. We
    promise that this system will bring together the worlds of different kinds of users engaged in different tasks at
    different times, and allow them shared authorial access to the same artefacts which are presented to each in a
    notation appropriate for them.”
* [Creating a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (2011)](https://gpii.net/sites/gpii.net/files/uploads/attachments/node/44/2011_aegis-creating_a_global_public_inclusive_infrastructure-final.doc)
  The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure ensures that everyone who faces accessibility barriers due to disability,
  literacy or aging, regardless of economic resources, can access and use the Internet and all its information,
  communities, and services for education, employment, daily living, civic participation, health and safety.
* [First Discovery](https://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/)
  This tool walks the people through a step by step process of discovering, declaring and storing digital preferences.
* [Discovery Cats](https://build-discoverycat.fluidproject.org/demo/)
  Play the Discovery Cats game, and [see some playful designs](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Discovery+Cats+-+First+Discovery)
  for setting user preferences and check out the [student project](https://github.com/fluid-lab/Discovery-Cat) that
  turned this into a game.
