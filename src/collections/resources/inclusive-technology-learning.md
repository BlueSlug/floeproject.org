### Inclusive technology for learning

Articles on the possibilities of inclusive learning technologies, and selected examples.

* [Interactive Simulations for Science and Math](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/accessibility/prototypes)
  Play with PhET’s fun, free, interactive, research-based science and mathematics simulations. Some sims such as
  [John Travoltage](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/john-travoltage/latest/john-travoltage_en.html) support
  keyboard-only access, audio description and sonification.
* [SNOW - Access to education using technology](https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/)
  Get information and training geared to educators, parents and students with disabilities on technologies for learning
  both in and out of the classroom.
* [Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL) Digital Tools](http://cisl.cast.org/)
  This suite of tools are designed to support the diverse needs of today’s learners. A demo of
  [the reader](http://cisl-demo.cast.org/index.html) is available.
* [Work in Progress Report: Nonvisual Visual Programming (2014)](http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2014-PPIG-25th-Lewis.pdf)
  > “Visual programming systems are widely used to introduce children and other learners to programming, but they cannot
    be used by blind people. Inspired by the ideas of blind computer scientist T.V.Raman, the Noodle system provides
    nonvisual access to a dataflow programming system, a popular model for visual programming systems.”
* [Georgia Tech Sonification Lab](http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/)
  > “The Sonification Lab focuses on the development and evaluation of auditory and multimodal interfaces, and the
    cognitive, psychophysical and practical aspects of auditory displays, paying particular attention to sonification.”
* [A Nonvisual Interface for a Blocks Language (2016)](http://www.ppig.org/library/paper/nonvisual-interface-blocks-language)
  > “We are building a nonvisual interface to a blocks language. We present a pseudospatial interface for the language,
    similar to that of Noodle, and compare it with other approaches to accessibility for blocks languages.”
* [Amara Video Captioning](https://amara.org/en/)
  Use Amara's technology to caption and subtitle any video for free.
* [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com/)
  Pressbooks easy-to-use book writing software enables people to create books in all the formats needed for publishing.
* [Interoperability for Individual Learner Centred Accessibility for Web-based Educational Systems (2006)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.9.4.215.pdf)
  This paper describes the AccessForAll accessibility strategy for delivering accessible computer based resources to
  individual learners based on their specified needs and preferences in the circumstances in which they are operating.
  Many of the resources presented here are based on this original work.
