The FLOE (Flexible Learning for Open Education) project aims to provide the resources needed to enable inclusive access
to personally relevant, engaging learning opportunities for the full diversity of learners and content producers.
Through the Open Education Resources community, FLOE will build tools that transform, augment, and personalize the
learning experience.

Learners learn best when the experience is personalized to individual needs. OER is an ideal learning environment to
meet the diverse needs of learners, including learners with disabilities. FLOE Project will support the OER community in
providing a sustainable, integrated approach to accessible learning, addressing the needs of learners who currently face
barriers.

FLOE is a project of the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/), [OCAD University](https://ocadu.ca/).

Funded by a grant from [The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](https://hewlett.org/).
