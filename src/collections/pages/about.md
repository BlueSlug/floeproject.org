The FLOE (Flexible Learning for Open Education) project aims to support diverse learners and educators in
learning to learn, life long learning and enabling learner agency.

Learners learn best when the experience is personalized to individual needs and Open Educational Resources (OER)
provide an opportunity to meet the diverse needs of learners, including learners with disabilities. The FLOE Project
supports the OER community in providing a sustainable, integrated approach to accessible learning,
addressing the needs of learners who currently face barriers. FLOE shares strategies and techniques that can be
used for inclusive learning and teaching through a variety of open guides and toolkits including the
[Community-Led Co-design Kit](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/),
the [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org/followaccessibilityprinciples),
and the [Inclusive Design Guide](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/)

Creating an ecosystem of inclusive tools that can be used for learning and teaching is another aspect
of the FLOE project. Focussing on tools that transform, augment, and personalize the learning experience
FLOE has been contributing to the [Fluid Infusion Framework](https://fluidproject.org/infusion.html)
which provides a technical base that can be used to create tools that are flexible and transformable.
The work on transforming web pages based on personal preferences can be seen in the 'show preferences'
panel at the top of this site and more information can be found on the [UI Options](/ui-options) page.

The FLOE project is integral to the Fluid open community where a global community of designers, developers and
people with varied lived experience provide support and advice for people working on learning content and tools.

FLOE is a project of the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/), [OCAD University](https://ocadu.ca/).

Funded by a grant from [The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](https://hewlett.org/).
