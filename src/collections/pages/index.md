The Floe project focuses on learner agency and life-long learning for all learners.

We share **strategies** and **techniques** for **inclusive teaching** that have come out of real world situations and
co-design with marginalized learners.

We build **inclusive tools** which prioritize personalized learning and individual reflection.

We are an open community that welcomes new ideas, content and contributions in the space of
**Inclusive Open Education**.
