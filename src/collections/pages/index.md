## Designing for Diverse Learners.

FLOE provides the resources to personalize how we each learn and to address barriers to learning. Learners learn
differently, and todayâ€™s society needs diverse, self-aware, life-long learners. FLOE supports learners, educators and
curriculum producers in achieving one-size-fits-one learning design for the full diversity of learners, leveraging the
variants made possible by [Open Education Resources](http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources)
(OER).

FLOE is led by the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](http://idrc.ocadu.ca) and applies Inclusive Design to open
learning.

## Watching a video in a loud room, reading in Braille, writing using an alternative keyboard or learning a new language?

Being able to transform, augment, and select alternative educational resources to fit individual needs is essential for
an inclusive learning experience. Open Educational Resources (OERs) are free and open for use and reuse in teaching,
learning and research. The OER ecosystem can provide an ever-increasing pool of alternative ways to learn. FLOE helps to
build knowledge about what works best for each learner.

## Want to select, refine and apply your preferences?

Preference editing tools help learners personalize their learning experience. [UI Options](https://build-infusion.fluidproject.org/demos/prefsframework/)
allows selection and fine-tuning of preferences. [Learn more](/ui-options/) about adding it to your site or
application.

Not sure how you learn best?

The [First Discovery Tool](https://build-firstdiscovery.fluidproject.org/demos/) helps newcomers learn about what kinds
of personalizations are possible, and what might work for them.

The [Preference Exploration Tool](https://build-prefseditors.fluidproject.org/demos/explorationtool/) offers a set of
starter preferences to try - from reading content aloud so it's easier to follow along, to enhancing keyboard
interactions so it's easier to use.

The [My Lifelong Learning Lab](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/CQHBAg) helps learners keep track of their progress, and
personalize their learning goals and learning experience through self-reflection.

The [Preference Management Tools](/preference-editing-tools/) support portable preferences - you can apply preferences across
devices, resources and learning applications using the <a href="http://gpii.net">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure.
The GPII [security architecture](/security-architecture/) gives you complete control over who has access to your preferences.

## Looking for help making rich content more inclusive?

The [HTML5 Video Player](https://build-videoplayer.fluidproject.org/demos/mammals) offers full keyboard access,
captions, transcripts, descriptions and responds to personal user preferences. Learners can request missing captions,
descriptions and transcripts, or create them.

Floe is also developing a [sonification framework](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Sonification)
that will help OER developers more easily create sound-based representations of interactive data that can increase
comprehension and reinforce learning.

The [Chart Authoring](https://build-chartauthoring.fluidproject.org/demos/) tool demonstrates how audio can enhance
comprehension of data.

[Inverted Wordles](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/inverted-wordles/) are word clouds that allow users to flip
the emphasis to highlight either the majority or minority answers. This provides a means to amplify minority voices,
elevating them to the forefront.

## Need guidance in designing accessible resources?

The [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](http://handbook.floeproject.org/) is an expanding source of guidance, tools and
tips for producing inclusively designed learning resources, including guidelines for creating [inclusive EPUB 3 resources](http://handbook.floeproject.org/InclusiveEPUB3.html)
, [accessible standardized tests](http://handbook.floeproject.org/AccessibleStandardizedTesting.html), and
[inclusive web games and simulations](http://handbook.floeproject.org/WebGamesAndSimulations.html).

Floe has created [The Inclusive Design Guide](http://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/) - an engaging and evolving resource for
learning about and applying Inclusive Design principles, practices, and tools to the design process.

The [Community-Led Co-design Kit](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/), is an open toolkit for sharing knowledge about
how to do co-design led by community members and organizations. Starting with
[the design process map and walking guide](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/design-process/) people can learn about
different paths and strategies for co-design. OER on [recruiting co-designers](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/resources/recruiting-co-designers/)
and providing [accessible and inclusive experiences](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/resources/accessibility-for-co-designers/)
provide some of the initial building blocks required. A set of [case studies](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca/case-studies/)
gives an in depth view of what community led co-design can be like.

The Metadata Editor makes it simple to provide useful labels regarding the learner preferences the resource can meet,
and supports authors in adding accessibility features. The Feedback Tool allows users to help in the refinement of
content and its metadata. The [source code for the Metadata Editor and Feedback Tool](https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata)
is available on Github.

Floe has added a [text-to-speech component](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/main/src/documents/TextToSpeechAPI.md)
to the Infusion JavaScript framework. The component uses browser-based speech synthesis to provide self-voicing
capabilities to web resources.
