[Coding to Learn and Create](https://www.codelearncreate.org/) is designing educational coding tools and resources for
students who have been left out of learning—especially those with complex needs.

Using the [Weavly](https://weavly.org/) accessible and customizable coding environment, the
[Open Robot Kit](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/open-robot-kit/) enables learners and educators to create a
‘one-size-fits-one’ robot that can become tools for expression and self-discovery.
