The FLOE project is working with [Coding to Learn and Create](https://www.codelearncreate.org/) in designing educational
coding tools and resources for students who have been left out of learning—especially those with complex needs.

* [Educator's Toolkit](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/?type=On-Screen)
  * A collection of open, coding related activities and resources for learners, parents and educators.
* [Weavly](https://weavly.org/)
  * An accessible and customizable coding environment co-designed with kids with complex disabilities.
* [Open Robot Kit](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/open-robot-kit/)
  * A kit that enables learners and educators to create a ‘one-size-fits-one’ robot that can be used for expression
    and self-discovery.
