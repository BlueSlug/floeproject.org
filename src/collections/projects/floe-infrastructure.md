The Floe Infrastructure for Individualized Learning provides a digital toolkit for learners that supports them in
discovering, gathering, and reflecting upon personal data about learning needs and approaches. The goal is to give
learners agency over their own data, and to encourage a curiosity-based approach in which it's okay to experiment,
gather different kinds of apparently unrelated data, and make tentative and unconventional correlations between their
personal data and other data gathered from the world at largeâ€”in order to support reflexive, personal, and social modes
of data-gathering and sense-making about learning.

The infrastructure includes:

* A way to [store personal needs and preferences](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/IUIGFVP/Preferences+Server)
  once, and access it anywhere
* User interface and content personalization tools (e.g. [UI Options](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=29959408))
* Ways to securely store, own, share, and govern personal data on the web
* Annotation and [narrative data-gathering tools](https://stories.floeproject.org/) (e.g. Storytelling, data journals,
  and personal timelines)
* Pluralistic data-gathering and analysis tools (e.g. Import data from spreadsheets, Nexus-enabled sensors/data loggers,
  data comparison and merging)
* Ways to visualize, sonify, and materialize personal data directly alongside learning content
* Algorithms and approaches that support automated analysis of small, "thick" individualized data sets, and to align
  them with other data sets within a community or learning circle
* "Metadata as data" tools that support learning communities in annotating and tagging learning content and relate it to
  personal learning needs and learning stories
