      <p>
      User Interface Options (or UI Options) provides a way to enhance or improve website usability, flexibility, and accessibility by providing a way to customize and control aspects of a website without the need for additional software or tools. For those who design, build, or maintain websites, UI Options can also help reveal areas where the web content and structure can be changed to improve flexibility and robustness.
