<p>
We Count is <a href="https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/inclusion-challenges/">
gathering challenges</a> faced by the community related to data ecosystem inclusion.
</p>
<p>
In two co-creation activities, We Count engaged diverse perspectives to consider
 the needs and requirements for a more equitable Smart City. Stories were co-created
  to uncover and explain challenges, needs, benefits and potential dangers of data-driven
   communities. The <a href="https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/journeys-through-the-digital-innovation-appendix-of-the-master-innovation-and-development-plan/">
   resulting reports</a> are openly available.

An illustrator provided a visual representation of these stories, specifically what can
 happen when decisions are based on audio sensor data that canâ€™t recognize uncontrollable
  noises such as involuntary vocalizations.

<p>The homeowner has a dismayed expression on their face, and the person in the uniform
 is saying: "I just respond to what the system tells me, and the system is saying you're
  too loud."</p>
