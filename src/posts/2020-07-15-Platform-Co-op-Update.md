<p>
The Platform Cooperative Development Kit project engaged in a number of co-design activities with
cooperative members-owners, and created the <a href="https://resources.platform.coop/">
Resource Library</a> to share information about platform coops.
</p>

<p>
Another resource, the Tool Library, is the result of designing with cooperatives a way to enable
knowledge sharing and tools for running their co-operatives. The Library is expected to go live
in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
The project also created <a href="https://pinecone.netlify.app/">Pinecone</a>, an open, reusable,
and accessible web component library for helping rapidly create websites.
