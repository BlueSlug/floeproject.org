The Coding to Learn project team has <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/
Coding+to+Learn+and+Create+Co-Design+Kit">created a co-design kit</a> aimed at engaging
kids with complex disabilities in coding skills and education is being created. The
growing collection of activities includes multi-modal collaborative art creation.
</p>

<p>
Since the COVID-19 isolation period, the team has explored remote coding and creativity
workshops. Working with teachers, parents and students with complex disabilities, the team
is developing a set of activities and processes to engage students remotely. These new
insights will be added to the co-design kit in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://build.codelearncreate.org/">The Inclusive Coding Environment</a> is being
developed through a collaborative co-design process, currently including remote co-design coding sessions.
</p>

<p>
An <a href="https://resources.codelearncreate.org/">Educatorâ€™s Toolkit</a> has been created
to provide teachers with resources for teaching coding to diverse students. The toolkit
will be redesigned and new resources will be added in the coming year.
