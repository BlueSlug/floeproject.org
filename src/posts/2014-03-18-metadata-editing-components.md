<p>The Floe team is developing a suite of tools for cr
eating more accessible and
personalizable web content by supporting the creation of accessi
bility metadata.
These tools will allow content creators to easily generate metadata at the point of creation,
reducing the cost and complexity of pro-ducing and delivering content that can be tailored to a userâ€™s needs and preferences.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/metadata/index
.html">demo</a>
of the latest work illustrates the metadata that can be automaticall
y generated during the process of adding a video to an OER. By build
ing tools that focus on content creation at the point of authoring,
Floe prioritizes accessibility metadata while providing built-in sol
utions suitable for any content authoring system.
