New content has been added to the
[Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](http://handbook.floeproject.org), including

- overviews of inclusive learning and accessibility principles,
- techniques for designing video and audio content and players to be inclusive,
- guidelines for authoring content that is inclusive
- and much more!

The Handbook is a free Open Educational Resource (OER) designed to assist teachers,
content creators, Web developers, and others in creating adaptable and
personalizable content that can accommodate a diversity of learning
styles and individual needs. Contributions are welcome and encouraged from all.
