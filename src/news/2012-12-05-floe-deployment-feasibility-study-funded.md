The U.S. Department of Education’s National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation
Research has recently announced funding for one of the projects that Floe is
participating in: "Profile Creation Support for Cloud-based Accessibility."
This project will harness global networks and cloud services to support
custom preferences that travel with a learner across devices and learning
environments, both on and off the Web, delivering appropriate solutions to
users anywhere, anytime and on any device or platform. The contract for
this project was awarded to the [Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education](http://www.iskme.org/)
