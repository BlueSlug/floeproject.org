In a traditional word cloud, the most popular answers (e.g. words, phrases) are emphasized. The result of this emphasis
is for the minority to fade away into the background. With their work on Inverted Wordles, the We Count team is seaking
a way to invert that relationship and provide a means to amplify those minority voices.
