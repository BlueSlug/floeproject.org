W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative will be hosting an Accessible E-Learning
online symposium on December 16, 2013. They are currently inviting submission of
new research, ongoing research, and analysis of past research related to e-learning accessibility.

Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning
systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously
from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will
explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility,
accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts,
privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics.

Participation in the symposium is free.
