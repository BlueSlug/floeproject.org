<p>Floe is working with <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET</a>
to improve the accessibility of their free, open, interactive physics simula
tions. Over the past
year, we have contributed research, ideas, and evaluations for improvemen
ts to two of PhET's simulations:
<a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Forces+and+Motion
+Simulation+Design">Forces and Motion Basics</a> and
<a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Si
mulation+Design">John Travoltage</a>.
</p>
<p>
The PhET team has been working to incorporate our input into a development ve
rsion of the
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basic
s/1.1.5-accessible-instance.3/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?accessibility&
screens=1">Forces and Motion: Basics</a>
simulation, and is now conducting user tests. Implementation of the new desig
ns for the John Travoltage simulation is planned for December 2015.

<p>
From this collaboration with PhET, a guide "<a href="http://handbook.floeprojec
t.org/WebGamesAndSimulations.html">Web Games and Simulations</a>" has been adde
d to the <a href="http://handbook.floeproject.org/">Inclusive Learning Design H
andbook</a> to help educators create more inclusive and accessible web games an
d educational simulations.
