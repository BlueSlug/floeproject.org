As part of a series of activities happening under the project
[‘El Planeta Es La Escuela’](https://karisma.org.co/el-planeta-es-la-escuela/)
and the Social Justice Repair Kit (SJRK) project, Karisma Foundation organised a 3-day
gathering that took place on May 24th-26th at
[Platohedro](http://platohedro.org) in Medellín, Colombia. Members of the Floe team
joined rural students from the agricultural
region of Fresno and women from
[Motivando a la Gyal](http://platohedro.org/motivando-a-la-gyal/)  for a series of workshops,
storytelling and knowledge sharing.
During the workshops participants explored ideas of inclusion and diversity using activities
such as collaborative art making as a
starting point for both individual and group storytelling.

The event enabled the development and refinement of several
[Inclusive Design activities](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Colombia+Visit+May+2018)
that will be added to the Inclusive Design Guide in the coming months. Participants tried
[the storytelling tool](https://karisma-stories.floeproject.org/)
being developed by the Floe and SJRK projects and the results from this hands on experience
will directly influence the development of the tool.

A highlight of the event was the knowledge sharing that took place between all participants.
The Platohedro collective has been very active
in community garden creation and was able to share their expertise with the group while
everyone learned much about agriculture and food
production from the rural students. In turn the students gained new insight into ideas
around gender and sexual identity through a workshop
hosted by members of Motivando a la Gyal. The Floe project representatives introduced
inclusive design ideas and methods as well as
Open Educational Resources such as
[PhET simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/accessibility/prototypes)
which will now be made available to the students at their rural schools.
