[Schema.org](http://schema.org/), a consortium of major search
engines including Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex, recently adopted accessibility
metadata properties based on the IMS Global Learning Consortium's [Access For All specification](http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility).
These additions will make it easier for publishers and webmasters to connect
learners with the most useful content, and help users with special needs locate
and consume content that is most appropriate for their specific needs.

The Floe team is working on [designs for a search interface](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/37855787/metadata-search.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1397078966717&api=v2) that would filter content based on
these properties.
