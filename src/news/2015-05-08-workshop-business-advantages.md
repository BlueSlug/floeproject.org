The [National Business and Disability Council (NBDC)](http://www.viscardicenter.org/services/nbdc/)
at [The Viscardi Center](http://www.viscardicenter.org/)
is offering an educational online workshop to focus on designing for diversity.

No one needs to point out that the current business climate is in a state of flux
and transformation. To thrive requires a good measure of agility, responsiveness,
continuous innovation and dynamic resiliency. These qualities are the by-products of
broadly diverse perspectives, skills, and approaches combined with the conditions
that foster their inclusion. Fortuitously, emerging technologies and associated
practices make it viable to move beyond mass design – in policy, communication,
product development, service, marketing, training and other business practices –
and make special the norm. If we proactively design for diversity we not only comply
with legislative requirements for accessibility but we also reap the benefits of
flexibility, adaptability and a spectrum of possible approaches, to thrive in a
quickly evolving business climate.
